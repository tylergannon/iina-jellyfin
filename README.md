- **Artists**: Browse by artist and drill down into their albums
- **Songs**: Browse individual tracks directly

Click an album to view its track listing. From there you can play individual tracks or use "Play All" to start the album. Use the Filter/Sort button to sort by name, date, or rating, and filter by genre.

Search also supports music content — use the "Albums" and "Songs" filter chips to find music across your library.

##### Advanced Filtering & Sorting

The Movies and TV Series tabs include powerful filtering and sorting tools to help you navigate large libraries:

**Sort Options:**

- **A-Z**: Sort alphabetically by title
- **Z-A**: Reverse alphabetical order
- **Date Added (Newest)**: Show recently added items first
- **Date Added (Oldest)**: Show oldest added items first
- **Release Date (Newest)**: Sort by year of release (newest first)
- **Rating (Highest)**: Sort by community rating (highest first)

**Filter Options:**

- **All**: Show all items
- **Unwatched**: Show only items you haven't watched yet
- **Favorites**: Show only items marked as favorites

**Genre Filter:**

- Dynamically populated list of genres from your library
- Select a specific genre to view only items in that category

Click the "Filter/Sort" button in the Movies or TV Series tab header to toggle the filter panel and customize your view.

## Supported URL Formats

The plugin automatically detects and processes Jellyfin URLs in these formats:

- Download URLs: `http://server:port/Items/{ItemId}/Download?ApiKey={key}` _(automatically stores credentials for sidebar login)_
- URLs containing `/Items/` and `ApiKey=` _(automatically stores credentials for sidebar login)_
- URLs containing "jellyfin", "/Audio/", or "/Videos/"

**Note**: URLs with API keys will automatically store authentication data for the sidebar browser, eliminating the need for manual login on first use.

## Configuration

Access plugin settings through IINA → Preferences → Plugins → Jellyfin:

### Authentication Settings

- **Enable automatic login from Jellyfin URLs**: Automatically extract server URL and API key from Jellyfin URLs for seamless login. Server credentials are stored permanently in your plugin preferences until manually removed via the sidebar server management panel.

### Media Playback Settings

- **Enable automatic subtitle download**: Toggle automatic downloading when opening Jellyfin URLs
- **Synchronize playback progress**: Enable bi-directional progress sync with Jellyfin server
  - Automatically resumes from last watched position when opening a video
  - Reports current playback position to Jellyfin every 10 seconds
  - Automatically marks items as watched at 95% completion
  - Resume positions sync across all your devices
- **Report to my connected account (ignore link's API key)**: When enabled, playback progress, resume, and watched status are reported to the Jellyfin account you're logged into via the browser sidebar, instead of the account whose `api_key` is embedded in the playing URL. Useful when several people open the same shared link (e.g. via Syncplay) — each viewer's progress records into their own account. Requires a logged-in server; falls back to the URL's `api_key` if none is connected.
- **Show on-screen notifications**: Display OSD messages when subtitles are downloaded
- **Preferred Languages**: Comma-separated language codes (e.g., `en,eng,pol,pl`)
- **Download all available subtitles**: Download all subtitle tracks, ignoring language preferences
- **Set video title from Jellyfin metadata**: Replace filenames with proper movie/show titles
- **Open media in new IINA window**: Play media from browser in separate windows
- **Enable autoplay**: Automatically queue the next episode when the current episode finishes, supporting cross-season playback

### Menu Options

The plugin adds these menu items to IINA:

- **Show Jellyfin Browser** (`Cmd+Shift+J`): Open the media browser sidebar
- **Download Jellyfin Subtitles**: Manually download subtitles for current media
- **Set Jellyfin Title**: Manually set video title from Jellyfin metadata
